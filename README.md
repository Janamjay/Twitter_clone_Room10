Welcome to Twitter Clone (Room10) - a delightful web application built using React, Material-UI, Recoil, and localStorage. This repository provides you with the code and resources to create a Twitter-like platform with a sleek user interface, state management using Recoil, and data persistence using localStorage.

## Features
